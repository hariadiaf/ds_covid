Though some of those issues have been addressed, substantial barriers—gerrymandering, voter registration, and voter ID laws—still restrain the power of the vote. Why? How can a country, founded more than 200 years ago on the ideals of liberty, equality, and individualism, still struggle to empower all of its citizens equally? This course explores the origins of U.S. political culture, how that culture informed the Constitution, and how that framework continues to influence the country’s politics and policies. We will examine the Constitution’s provisions for limited government, the division of power between the federal and state governments, and the forces that have made federalism a source of political conflict and change. We will address how the Constitution not only established the structure of the U.S. government but guarantees personal freedoms and civil rights. These rights have been challenged and expanded in significant Supreme Court cases, which will help to illustrate how historically disadvantaged groups have struggled to realize the 14th Amendment's promise of equality.",american government constitutional foundations,social sciences,introductory,people opening words constitution yet original document give citizens much say election officials though issues addressed substantial barriers gerrymandering voter registration voter id laws still restrain power vote country founded years ago ideals liberty equality individualism still struggle empower citizens equally course explores origins political culture culture informed constitution framework continues influence country politics policies examine constitution provisions limited government division power federal state governments forces made federalism source political conflict change address constitution established structure government guarantees personal freedoms civil rights rights challenged expanded significant supreme court cases help illustrate historically disadvantaged groups struggled realize amendment promise equality

We’ll examine the attributes of public opinion, how polling attempts to measure those attributes, and how they impact the decisions of policymakers. We’ll address the unique features of the two-party system in the U.S., how those parties realign themselves in response to shifting norms, and how their candidates are vetted behind the scenes before the start of a campaign. Outside of the formal organization of party politics, groups representing various interests aim to affect a change through the political system. Special interest groups resemble political parties, but while parties try to influence elections, groups concentrate on gaining influence over policies. Meanwhile, social movements take place outside these established institutions, often in the form of protest demonstrations and rallies. All of these interests are filtered through the news media, which plays a critical role in shaping people’s images of politics.

Women are running for political office in record numbers. Women are organizing and taking to the streets to demand change. Women are grappling with inclusion and intersectionality. While some of this activity may have been a response to the 2016 presidential elections, its roots lie deep in 20th-century history — a history richly preserved in Harvard’s Schlesinger Library building on the library’s 75th Anniversary Exhibit. This course exemplifies the importance of archives in the making of history. Professors Laurel Ulrich and Jane Kamensky, along with colleagues from across Harvard University and beyond, show how women in the 20th-century United States pushed boundaries, fought for new rights, and challenged contemporary notions of what women could and should do. Through the exploration of ten iconic objects from the Schlesinger collection, they demonstrate how women created change by embracing education, adopting new technologies, and creating innovative works of art; pushing against discrimination and stepping into new roles in public and in private.",women making history ten objects many stories,humanities,introductory,approach centennial passage women suffrage recent burst activism among american women women running political office record numbers women organizing taking streets demand change women grappling inclusion intersectionality activity may response presidential elections roots lie deep century history history richly preserved harvard schlesinger library building library anniversary exhibit course exemplifies importance archives making history professors laurel ulrich jane kamensky along colleagues across harvard university beyond show women century united states pushed boundaries fought new rights challenged contemporary notions women could exploration ten iconic objects schlesinger collection demonstrate women created change embracing education adopting new technologies creating innovative works art pushing discrimination stepping new roles public private
